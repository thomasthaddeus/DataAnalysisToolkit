"""data_prep.py

This module provides a class, DataPreprocessor, for preprocessing data. It
includes functionalities to standardize or normalize data, which is an
essential step in many data analysis and machine learning workflows.

The DataPreprocessor class is designed to preprocess datasets, particularly
useful in preparing data for machine learning models. Currently, it supports
data standardization, a process of scaling data such that it has a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1. This is often required to ensure that all
features contribute equally to the result and to improve the convergence of
algorithms.
