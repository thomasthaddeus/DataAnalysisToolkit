# TODO list

1. **Automated Data Import and Integration**: Beyond loading CSV files, expand the toolkit to import data from different sources such as Excel files, databases (SQL), and APIs. This feature would enable users to automatically integrate data from various sources.

2. **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Include more advanced statistical methods like regression analysis, ANOVA, time series analysis, and hypothesis testing. This would allow for a broader range of statistical inquiries and deeper data insights.

3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate basic machine learning algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, and clustering. This could also include features for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capabilities**: Add NLP features to analyze textual data. This could include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification, which are increasingly important in data analysis.

5. **Automated Data Quality Checks**: Implement features for automatic detection of data quality issues like inconsistencies, anomalies, and biases in datasets.

6. **Interactive Dashboards and Reporting**: Provide functionalities to create interactive dashboards and automated reports. This would help in visualizing data insights and sharing them with non-technical stakeholders.

7. **Real-time Data Analysis**: Enable the toolkit to handle streaming data, allowing for real-time data analysis which is crucial for applications like monitoring systems, financial markets, and IoT devices.

8. **Customizable Data Transformation Pipelines**: Allow users to create and save custom data transformation pipelines that can be reused across different projects. This feature would be useful in standardizing data preprocessing steps.

9. **Parallel Processing and Optimization**: Optimize the toolkit for performance by enabling parallel processing, which is beneficial for handling large datasets.

10. **User-friendly GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the toolkit, making it accessible to users who are not comfortable with coding.

11. **Integration with Cloud Services**: Facilitate integration with cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for data storage, processing, and analysis in a cloud environment.

12. **Expandable Plugin Architecture**: Create an architecture that allows other developers to easily add new features or integrations as plugins.

13. **Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials**: Provide detailed documentation and tutorials for all features, including real-world use case examples, to make the toolkit more accessible to a wider audience.
