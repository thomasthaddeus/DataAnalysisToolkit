# DataAnalyzer

The `DataAnalyzer` project is a Python-based data analysis tool designed to streamline various data analysis tasks. It allows users to load data from CSV files and perform operations such as statistical calculations, outlier detection, data cleaning, and visualization.

## Key Features

1. **Statistical Calculations**: It provides easy methods to calculate common statistics like mean, median, mode, and trimmed mean of any given column in the data.

2. **Outlier Detection**: It contains methods to identify outliers in the data using the z-score method.

3. **Data Cleaning**: It offers functionalities to handle missing values (either by dropping or filling them), drop duplicate rows, and encode categorical features.

4. **Data Splitting**: It includes a method to split the data into training and testing sets, which is often required in machine learning tasks.

5. **Visualization**: It provides the ability to plot histograms of any column in the data, aiding in visual data analysis.

6. **Data Export**: It allows users to export the analyzed data to a new CSV file.

This tool is highly beneficial for data analysts and data scientists, offering them a simplified interface for conducting preliminary data analysis. It can also be incorporated into larger data processing pipelines, serving as a preprocessing step for machine learning models.
